Maintained 

 

Huadian Power’s 1H07 net profit of RMB543mn (+1.4% y-y) is in line with our 
estimate, and accounts for 40.3% of our full-year forecast as we expect a stronger 
second half on capacity expansion. Output expansion and a tariff increment more 
than offset higher fuel costs, lifting operating profit by 13.5%. Tax benefits helped to 
offset higher finance costs. With no major surprises, plus a bright FY08F outlook 
and potential upside from a group listing, we retain our STRONG BUY rating.

Deferred tax at work  
(cid:122)  We estimate the 1H07 weighted average tariff at RMB310.4/MWh 
(+1.8% y-y, as reported). The reported unit fuel cost rose by 6.0% 
y-y to RMB173.3/MWh, below our full-year forecast of +7.5% y-y. 
We believe the base for year-on-year comparison was adjusted for 
50%-owned Zhongning plant (moved to associate income from 
FY07F). To recap, output expanded by 22% to 28,900GWh.  

(cid:122)  Operating margin fell to 14.0%, from 15.2% in 1H06. Due to the 

commissioning of new capacity, depreciation costs rose by 44.2% 
y-y and net finance cost surged 146.6% y-y. Labour costs (-15.2% 
y-y) and administrative costs (+9.6% y-y) were well contained.  

(cid:122)  Pre-tax profit fell by 18.7% y-y to RMB712.4mn. The bottom line, 
however, was helped by a deferred tax writeback of RMB137.9mn 
in preparation for the tax rate unification (see our short report titled 
Group therapy, 8 August 2007). As a result, income tax was only 
RMB2.0mn in 1H07, versus RMB275.0mn in 1H06.

(cid:122)  Total equity capacity of 2,766MW started operations in April-July, 
and a further 2,148MW will start before year-end. These will boost 
the company’s equity capacity by 41.8% from the end-FY06 level.  

(cid:122)  Despite a 27.3% rebound since 17 August, the stock is attractive 
at 11.1x FY08F P/E. Given a bright FY08F outlook and potential 
upside from asset injections, we are reviewing our fair value. We 
would see any negative reaction to the results as a chance to buy.

Explanation of Nomura rating system for Asian companies under coverage 
ex Japan: 
Stocks: 
Stock recommendations are based on absolute valuation upside (downside), which is defined as (Fair 
Value Current Price) / Current Price, subject to limited management discretion. In most cases, the Fair 
Value will equal the analyst's assessment of the current intrinsic fair value of the stock using an 
appropriate valuation methodology such as Discounted Cash Flow or Multiple analysis etc. However, if 
the analyst doesn't think the market will revalue the stock over the specified time horizon due to a lack 
of events or catalysts, then the fair value may differ from the intrinsic fair value. In most cases, 
therefore, our recommendation is an assessment of the difference between current market price and 
our estimate of current intrinsic fair value. Recommendations are set with a 6-12 month horizon unless 
specified otherwise. Accordingly, within this horizon, price volatility may cause the actual upside or 
downside based on the prevailing market price to differ from the upside or downside implied by the 
recommendation. 
A "Strong Buy" recommendation indicates that upside is more than 20%. 
A "Buy" recommendation indicates that upside is between 10% and 20%. 
A "Neutral" recommendation indicates that upside or downside is less than 10%. 
A "Reduce" recommendation indicates that downside is between 10% and 20%. 
A "Sell" recommendation indicates that downside is more than 20%. 
Sectors: 
A "Bullish" rating means most stocks in the sector have (or the weighted average recommendation of 
the stocks under coverage is) a positive absolute recommendation. 
A "Neutral" rating means most stocks in the sector have (or the weighted average recommendation of 
the stocks under coverage is) a neutral absolute recommendation. 
A "Bearish" rating means most stocks in the sector have (or the weighted average recommendation of 
the stocks under coverage is) a negative absolute recommendation.
