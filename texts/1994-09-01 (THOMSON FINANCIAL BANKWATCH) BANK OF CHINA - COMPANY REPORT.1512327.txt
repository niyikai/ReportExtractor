PERFORMANCE
OVERVIEW                                                                    (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     NO appraisal of Bank China is possible on the basis of its             (cid:13)
published accounts. It is very likely that, with the exception of           (cid:13)
liquidity, none of its performance ratios could be taken as a faithful      (cid:13)
representation of the bank's business on the basis of a conventional        (cid:13)
analysis. Capital ratios should be adjusted to take into account the        (cid:13)
sad reality of sour loans to state-owned companies. Profits are largely     (cid:13)
influenced by the state-controlled domestic interest structure and the      (cid:13)
various tasks required from Bank of China besides commercial banking.       (cid:13)
The profits of Bank of China are the result from roughly three              (cid:13)
activities: the very profitable operations in Hong Kong and Singapore,      (cid:13)
the near monopoly in foreign exchange transactions in the PRC, and the      (cid:13)
unprofitable domestic operations. BOC is more profitable than the other     (cid:13)
three specialized banks of China, and it is likely that the authorities     (cid:13)
will ensure that it will remain that way.                                   (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     Bank of China's Loans-to-Total Deposits ratio is 60% and its           (cid:13)
Loans-to-Customers Deposits ratio at 87% is comfortable, but its net        (cid:13)
interest margin is a low 1.11%, even if it is an improvement over the       (cid:13)
1992 ratio. It is however a clear indication that a huge proportion of      (cid:13)
the bank's portfolio must be non-performing. Clearly the bank's net         (cid:13)
margins are dragged down by its domestic operations. It can be safely       (cid:13)
assumed that a large part of the "other expenses" is meant to cover bad     (cid:13)
loans. This represented only about 0.6% of the portfolio every year         (cid:13)
until 1992, but it jumped to 1% of the portfolio in 1993 and this is        (cid:13)
one of the most important factors in the bank's declining                   (cid:13)
profitability.                                                              (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     The very high interest margins enjoyed in Hong Kong by the             (cid:13)
consolidated subsidiaries and by Bank of China's branch might account       (cid:13)
for two-thirds of the net interest income, leaving the interest margins     (cid:13)
generated by domestic operations and foreign operations outside Hong        (cid:13)
Kong at a much lower 0.25%. It shows that the bank cannot control its       (cid:13)
domestic lending and borrowing rates and must survive on whatever the       (cid:13)
monetary authorities will allow.                                            (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     In 1993, non-lending income represented a hefty 0.79% of average       (cid:13)
assets (0.76% in 1992), which is highly unusual. But Bank of China has      (cid:13)
a near monopoly on import and export credits, which could generate high     (cid:13)
fees, and on foreign exchange transactions. The bank also handles the       (cid:13)
PRC's foreign reserves (approximately US$ 20 billion), the foreign          (cid:13)

     Chinese banks are said to be threatened by rising bad debts as in      (cid:13)
the past unprofitable state corporations were able to get bank loans.       (cid:13)
Lending to badly managed state companies is part of BOC's duties. In        (cid:13)
such cases, loans are never considered as bad. The official line is         (cid:13)
that, even if the loans cannot be repaid, the state's implicit              (cid:13)
guarantee is good enough for the loans to be considered current.            (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     In the past, the Chinese government would simply ensure that           (cid:13)
multilateral inter-company debts between state-owned firms were getting     (cid:13)
squared off from time to time, and that the banks would write off their     (cid:13)
exposure to net losers. But in recent times volumes have increased and      (cid:13)
state-owned corporations have accumulated more net losses than the          (cid:13)
entire equity of the banking system.                                        (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     The picture will one day look clearer when all development and         (cid:13)
priority loans are taken off the books of the four specialized banks        (cid:13)
and parked into special institutions which will act as a buffer between     (cid:13)
loss-making state firms and the nation's budget. Steps have just been       (cid:13)
taken in that direction.                                                    (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     Asset quality remains the main factor affecting the assessment of      (cid:13)
Bank of China and as long as its status is not modified, it will be         (cid:13)
necessary to accept that, indeed, a substantial part of its domestic        (cid:13)
portfolio is made of doubtful loans, enough to potentially wipe out its     (cid:13)
shareholders funds.                                                         (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     An additional factor is the large amount of guarantees given by        (cid:13)
Bank of China through its various branches for commercial loans granted     (cid:13)
by foreign parties to domestic borrowers.                                   (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     It is impossible to study Bank of China's capital adequacy, as its     (cid:13)
actual equity is influenced both by huge potential losses and by the        (cid:13)
active support of the authorities.                                          (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     Shareholders equity has been growing rapidly in the last few years     (cid:13)
to reach almost US$ 12 billion and, even with all profits plugged back      (cid:13)
into the bank, fresh funds were injected on many occasions. The bank is     (cid:13)
keen on following the requirements of the Basle agreement in order to       (cid:13)
improve its image internationally. The present leverage of 19 times,        (cid:13)
although higher than in previous years, remains acceptable (albeit on       (cid:13)
the high side) by international standards. Bank of China does not           (cid:13)
publish its BIS ratio. A rough estimate would put that ratio at about       (cid:13)
10%, well within guidelines.                                                (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     At the end of 1993, 28% of BOC's assets were overseas assets,          (cid:13)
while a startling 68% of domestic assets were classified as foreign         (cid:13)
exchange assets. Most of the assets denominated in RMB, representing        (cid:13)
approximately US$ 54 billion, were for local lending. About 51% of          (cid:13)
customers deposits are gathered in China, of which 56% are in RMB.          (cid:13)
Individuals hold about 33% of foreign currency deposits gathered in         (cid:13)
China.                                                                      (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     BOC always controls its global assets and liabilities with             (cid:13)
remarkable skill and maintains good liquidity ratios with Loans-            (cid:13)
to-Total Deposits not exceeding 60%. The Quasi-Liquid Asset ratio           (cid:13)
declined significantly in 1993, falling from 34% to 28%, showing BOC's      (cid:13)
sudden change in strategy, with more fresh loans than fresh deposits        (cid:13)

recorded during the year. This might be the result of government            (cid:13)
pressure on large banks to provide funds to state- owned companies on       (cid:13)
the verge of collapse in order to postpone drastic bankruptcy decisions     (cid:13)
with their obvious social repercussions.                                    (cid:13)

     Bank of China is the second largest bank in China after ICBC and       (cid:13)
it is one of the four specialized banks, having been trusted for many       (cid:13)
years with the lion's share of the country's foreign exchange and           (cid:13)
international activities.                                                   (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     BOC is the oldest bank in the PRC with its history being able to       (cid:13)
be traced back to 1905 when the Jing Dynasty established the Da Jing        (cid:13)
Bank. In January 1912, the bank was re-organized and named Bank of          (cid:13)
China by Dr. Sun Yat Sen with its headquarters being situated in            (cid:13)
Shanghai. Before the Central Bank was setup in the PRC in 1928, BOC         (cid:13)
basically took the role on top of its commercial banking function.          (cid:13)
After the Communists had risen to power, all banks in the country were      (cid:13)
unified into one, the People's Bank of China, and BOC basically acted       (cid:13)
as the international department with its name being maintained              (cid:13)
externally. Since March 1979, BOC has been separated from the People's      (cid:13)
Bank of China to become a specialized bank.                                 (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     The bank's domestic network has grown dramatically in the last two     (cid:13)
years, jumping from 4,813 branches in 1991 to 6,183 in 1992 and 8,894       (cid:13)
in 1993. Most of the expansion was in small savings offices which           (cid:13)
represent 68% of the total. Domestic staff has reached 156,000 at the       (cid:13)
end of 1993, having jumped 36% in the year. Another 19,000 staff are        (cid:13)
employed in 474 offices abroad, many of which are in Hong Kong and          (cid:13)
Macau in BOC's sister banks. Technically, BOC only owns six of the          (cid:13)
sister banks but it has a mandate to control most of the PRC-owned          (cid:13)
banks in Hong Kong and Macau.                                               (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     Overseas operations have experienced strong growth in recent           (cid:13)
years, with total overseas assets topping US$ 100 billion for the first     (cid:13)
time in 1993. The bank has expanded its existing operations in Paris,       (cid:13)
London, Luxembourg, Frankfurt and New York, and has opened branches and     (cid:13)
representative offices in Tokyo, Osaka, Los Angeles, Moscow, Cayman,        (cid:13)
Panama and Sydney in the last few years. 1993 has seen the bank open        (cid:13)
full branches in both Toronto and Rome. It is present in Thailand,          (cid:13)
Korea, Scotland, Canada, Cayman Islands, Panama and Kazakhstan.             (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     Despite new competitors, the BOC remains the major Chinese player      (cid:13)
on international markets and leads China's efforts in borrowing funds       (cid:13)
overseas. For obvious reasons, Bank of China will have to play a            (cid:13)
significant role in Hong Kong after 1997, and already today no              (cid:13)
important decision regarding the banking sector in Hong Kong can be         (cid:13)
taken without consultations with Bank of China.                             (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     Foreign trade and foreign exchange remain Bank of China's forte,       (cid:13)
although its near-monopoly position in foreign exchange transactions is     (cid:13)
now being challenged by newcomers such as CITIC Industrial Bank, the        (cid:13)
Agricultural Bank and the Industrial Bank. But BOC's domestic portfolio     (cid:13)
also includes infrastructure, construction and industrial credits. It       (cid:13)
is the bank's wishes to play an increasing role in the financing of         (cid:13)
joint ventures in China, if only because it would be the only way to        (cid:13)
keep foreign banks interested in contributing their share. The bank has     (cid:13)
recently started offering housing loans. Total transaction value on its     (cid:13)
1.14 million credit cards has reached close to US$ 21 billion in 1993.      (cid:13)
Services such as its innovative phone call banking option have also         (cid:13)
been extended.                                                              (cid:13)

     The Bank of China was established by the government with some          (cid:13)
private injections. Since the nationalization when the Communists rose      (cid:13)
to power, BOC has become wholly owned by the Chinese State and is as        (cid:13)
such a sovereign risk. While still largely autonomous, the bank falls       (cid:13)
under the authority of the People's Bank of China, which acts as the        (cid:13)
central bank.                                                               (cid:13)

PROFITABILITY
     * Bank of China is more profitable than the other three                (cid:13)
specialized banks of China, but it is important to realize that the         (cid:13)
figures cannot be trusted until the matter of its non- performing loans     (cid:13)
is settled. Published profits have declined in absolute terms in 1993,      (cid:13)
and BOC posted a Return on Average Assets ratio of 0.79%, down from         (cid:13)
1.08% in 1991 and 1.01% in 1992. The profits of Bank of China are the       (cid:13)
result from roughly three activities: the very profitable operations in     (cid:13)
Hong Kong and Singapore, the near monopoly in foreign exchange              (cid:13)
transactions in the PRC, and the unprofitable domestic operations. Bank     (cid:13)
of China discloses many more P&L details than any bank operating mostly     (cid:13)
in Hong Kong, but it is still difficult to assess the contribution of       (cid:13)
each of the components of its income. Bank of China's Loans- to-Total       (cid:13)
Deposits ratio is 60% and its Loans-to-Customers Deposits ratio at 87%      (cid:13)
is comfortable, but its net interest margin is a low 1.11%, even if it      (cid:13)
is an improvement over the 1992 ratio. It is however an indication that     (cid:13)
a huge proportion of the bank's portfolio may be non-performing.            (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     * Clearly the bank's net margins are dragged down by its domestic      (cid:13)
operations. The very high interest margins enjoyed in Hong Kong by the      (cid:13)
consolidated subsidiaries and by Bank of China's branch might account       (cid:13)
for two-thirds of the net interest income, leaving the interest margins     (cid:13)
generated by domestic operations and foreign operations outside Hong        (cid:13)
Kong at a much lower level. It shows that the bank cannot control its       (cid:13)
domestic lending and borrowing rates and must survive on whatever the       (cid:13)
monetary authorities will allow.                                            (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     * In 1993, non-lending income represented a hefty 0.79% of average     (cid:13)
assets (0.76% in 1992), which is highly unusual. But Bank of China has      (cid:13)
a near monopoly on import and export credits, which could generate high     (cid:13)
fees, and on foreign exchange transactions. The bank also handles the       (cid:13)
PRC's foreign reserves (approximately US$ 20 billion) and the foreign       (cid:13)
exchange holdings of state-owned firms (about US$ 30 billion). Now that     (cid:13)

individuals are encouraged to maintain foreign exchange funds with          (cid:13)
local banks, BOC had about US$ 9 billion in such deposits at the end of     (cid:13)
1993.                                                                       (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)

     * On the expenditure side, the bank has only one entry for taxes,      (cid:13)
bad debt provisioning, depreciation and other expenses. This level of       (cid:13)
disclosure is much better than in Singapore or in Hong Kong, but the        (cid:13)
bank refuses to reveal more details. It can be safely assumed that a        (cid:13)
large part of the "other expenses" is meant to cover bad loans. This        (cid:13)
represented only about 0.6% of the portfolio every year until 1992, but     (cid:13)
it jumped to 1% of the portfolio in 1993. This provisioning strategy is     (cid:13)
of course unrealistic and therefore BOC's income figures are very           (cid:13)
artificial.                                                                 (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     * To the extent that other commercial banks might receive              (cid:13)
permission to compete with Bank of China for non-lending business, the      (cid:13)
bank might see its profitability erode further. On the other hand, Bank     (cid:13)
of China in a not-too-distant future is poised to take over many of the     (cid:13)
invisible but profitable rewards of taking over HSBC's role as HK           (cid:13)
quasi-central bank. Furthermore, if and when the PRC authorities            (cid:13)
succeed in transferring policy loans from specialized banks to              (cid:13)
development banks, BOC will enjoy much improved interest margins.           (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
ASSET QUALITY
                                                                            (cid:13)
     * Bank of China is unwilling to comment on the quality of its          (cid:13)
portfolio. All PRC banks are secretive about that problem, except to        (cid:13)
claim that it is under control. This may well not be the case, but the      (cid:13)
banks themselves cannot be blamed for their predicament.                    (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     * Chinese banks are said to be threatened by rising bad debts as       (cid:13)
in the past unprofitable state corporations were able to get bank           (cid:13)
loans. Lending to badly managed state companies is part of BOC's            (cid:13)
duties. In such cases, loans are never considered as bad. The official      (cid:13)
line is that, even if the loans cannot be repaid, the state's implicit      (cid:13)
guarantee is good enough for the loans to be considered current. Bank       (cid:13)
of China operates in a country which has its own rules and where state      (cid:13)
banks are simply a specialized arm of the Ministry of Finance. It is as     (cid:13)
if customer deposits were financing the state deficit and loans were        (cid:13)
government subsidies. In most cases, bank loans constitute at least 80%     (cid:13)
of the resources of state firms.                                            (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     * In the past, the Chinese government would simply ensure that         (cid:13)
multilateral inter-company debts between state-owned firms were getting     (cid:13)
squared from time to time, and that the banks would write off their         (cid:13)
exposure to net losers. But in recent times volumes have increased and      (cid:13)
state-owned corporations have accumulated more net losses than the          (cid:13)
entire equity of the banking system. It is impossible to assess what        (cid:13)
banks like BOC should provision to meet its share of the losses, but        (cid:13)
the matter is in fact irrelevant because China does not follow western      (cid:13)
accounting principles.                                                      (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)

     * The picture will one day look clear when all development and         (cid:13)
priority loans are taken off the books of the four specialized banks        (cid:13)
and parked into special institutions which will act as a buffer between     (cid:13)
loss-making state firms and the nation's budget. Steps have just been       (cid:13)
taken in that direction.                                                    (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     * Asset quality remains the main factor affecting the assessment       (cid:13)
of Bank of China. While the bank is acting like any capitalist              (cid:13)
financial institution in Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, Australia, Europe     (cid:13)
and the USA, it still has huge assets on the PRC domestic market.           (cid:13)
Fortunately many loans are granted to joint-ventures with foreign           (cid:13)
partners, and to Chinese firms involved in foreign trade. Such loans        (cid:13)
could be of acceptable quality. But as long as Bank of China's status       (cid:13)
is not modified, it will be necessary to accept that, indeed, a             (cid:13)
substantial part of its domestic portfolio is made of doubtful loans.       (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     * An additional factor is the amount of guarantees given by Bank       (cid:13)
of China through its various branches for commercial loans granted by       (cid:13)
foreign parties to domestic borrowers. The guarantee total is in the        (cid:13)
region of US$30 billion, against the background of US$107 billion in        (cid:13)
recorded loans and US$12 billion in shareholders' equity. This is           (cid:13)
extremely high by any standards.                                            (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)

BALANCE SHEET/CAPITAL
     * Bank of China does not reveal details about the distribution of      (cid:13)
its profits but this is not important. Whether dividends were paid or       (cid:13)
not, shareholders equity has been growing rapidly in the last few years     (cid:13)
and, even with all profits plugged back into the bank, fresh funds were     (cid:13)
injected on many occasions. The paid-up capital remained unchanged in       (cid:13)
1990 but it grew 20% in 1991 and 67% in 1992, mostly through the            (cid:13)
capitalization of reserves. No change was recorded in 1993. This            (cid:13)
brought equity to a level of almost US$12 billion. Asset growth slowed      (cid:13)
down since 1991 and so did equity growth. It is clear that BOC has made     (cid:13)
the effort to support its expansion with adequate equity. The bank is       (cid:13)
keen on following the requirements of the Basle agreement in order to       (cid:13)
improve its image internationally. Bank of China does not publish its       (cid:13)
BIS ratio. A rough estimate would put that ratio at about 10%, well         (cid:13)
within guidelines. It is perhaps necessary to mention here that the         (cid:13)
bank may or may not follow international accounting practices, and that     (cid:13)
there might be uncertainties about the valuation of some assets.            (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     * At the end of 1993, 28% of BOC's assets were overseas assets,        (cid:13)
while a startling 68% of domestic assets were classified as foreign         (cid:13)

exchange assets. Most of the assets denominated in RMB, representing        (cid:13)
approximately US$ 54 billion, were local lending.                           (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     * About 51% of customers deposits are deposits gathered in China,      (cid:13)
of which 56% are in RMB. Individuals hold about 33% of foreign currency     (cid:13)
deposits gathered in China.                                                 (cid:13)

     * Bank of China's accounts do not include the roughly US$20            (cid:13)
billion of foreign reserves it handles on behalf of the People's Bank.      (cid:13)
But the published accounts show very substantial interbank borrowing        (cid:13)
and lending, most of it with foreign banks. Domestic interbank              (cid:13)
transactions are small and, on the liabilities side, they are included      (cid:13)
in customers' deposits.                                                     (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     * Bank of China is one very few large banks to keep substantial        (cid:13)
amounts in foreign currency in non-interbank accounts on both sides of      (cid:13)
the balance sheet. Such a situation makes asset/liability management        (cid:13)
more difficult than it would be in local currency.                          (cid:13)
                                                                            (cid:13)
     * BOC always controls its global assets and liabilities with           (cid:13)
remarkable skill and maintains good liquidity ratios with Loans-            (cid:13)
to-Total Deposits not exceeding 60%. The Quasi-Liquid Asset ratio           (cid:13)
declined significantly in 1993, falling from 34% to 28%, showing BOC's      (cid:13)
sudden change in strategy, with more fresh loans than fresh deposits        (cid:13)
recorded during the year. This might be the result of government            (cid:13)
pressure on large banks to provide funds to state- owned companies on       (cid:13)
the verge of collapse in order to postpone drastic bankruptcy decisions     (cid:13)
with their obvious social repercussions.                                    (cid:13)
