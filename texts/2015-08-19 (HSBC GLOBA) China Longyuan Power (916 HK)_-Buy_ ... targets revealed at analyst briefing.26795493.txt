Buy: More solid targets revealed at analyst briefing 

  At the analyst briefing hosted on 19 August, Longyuan 

revealed more solid targets for 2015 and beyond 

  Better capacity targets for 2015-20; maintenance costs and 

curtailment rates should be under control 

  Reiterate Buy and HKD11 TP; guidance provides better clarity  
    
Key takeaways from analyst briefing in Hong Kong (19 August) 
Wind capacity increased, to grow 2.0-2.6GW in 2015 (previous: 1.8-2.2GW): With 
wind capacity growing 0.9GW in 1H15, management has lifted its target to add 2.0-
2.6GW for the full year 2015, from its previous 1.8-2.2GW. 

Capacity to grow at least 2.0GW pa until 2020: Longyuan expects to add at least 
2.0GW pa during the 13th Five Year Plan (2016-20), with cumulative capacity reaching 
c26GW by 2020. This excludes off-shore wind farms of 0.3GW scheduled to be 
developed in 2016, and 0.5-0.6GW pa in 2017-18. 
China might raise wind target for 2020: Management says it is aware of press speculation 
that China will raise its 2020 target for wind capacity to 250-280GW, from 200GW. 
Longyuan sees upside to the current target, but did not provide an absolute figure. 
Maintenance costs could rise but are under control: Repairs and maintenance came in 
at RMB1.2cents/kWh (ie RMB0.012/kWh) during 1H15, accounting for 3.1-3.2% of total 
operating costs. For 2015, management expects to control this at around RMB1.5cents/kWh, 
accounting for 3-4% of operating costs. 

Curtailment to be controlled at c10% in 2015 (1H15: 11.92%; 1H14: 11.27%): In 
1H15, Longyuan's curtailment edged up to 11.92% (1H14: 11.27%), due to issues relating 
to power distribution in Gansu and Xinjiang. Curtailment rates in both places had jumped 
to 34% (from 18%) and 22% (18%) during the same period, vs China's average of 15.2%.  
Management believes such issues are mainly related to the grid's unwillingness to 
despatch renewable energy, but such executive issues could be resolved soon after the 
scheduled tariff cut in January 2016. Management expects to control curtailment at around 
10% for 2015, implying an improvement ahead. Longyuan's utilisation improved by 49 
hours in 1H15, attributed to better wind conditions (+89 hours), but offset by more serious 
curtailment at the grid (-40 hours).

Operating leverage is realized: Due to increased generation and scale, operating costs per kWh came in 
at RMB0.326/kWh (2014: RMB0.358/kWh). 

FCF to turn positive in 2-3 years:  On renewed capacity targets, Longyuan expects its FCF to turn 
positive in 2-3 years. 

Dividend policy and business strategy unchanged: Management says it will continue its existing 20% 
dividend payout. Even when Longyuan has achieved positive FCF and accumulated extra cash in the 
future, wind energy should remain its focus until 2020. 
Valuation and risks 
Reiterate Buy rating with TP at HKD11.00  
Our target price is based on the average of our DCF and RoE implied PB valuations. Our DCF fair value 
is HKD11.12 per share based on a WACC of 5.3% (using a risk free rate of 3.5%, equity risk premium of 
5.5% and equity beta of 0.6). Our RoE-implied PB fair value is HKD8.79 per share based on FY15e book 
value and RoE/CoE PB multiple of 1.59 (using 6.8% cost of equity, sustainable RoE (2015-16e of 
10.8%). We apply a 10% premium for the long-term carbon benefit.  

Downside risks: lower generation; fewer new-builds and higher operation costs.

Analyst Certification 
The following analyst(s), economist(s), and/or strategist(s) who is(are) primarily responsible for this report, certifies(y) that the 
opinion(s) on the subject security(ies) or issuer(s) and/or any other views or forecasts expressed herein accurately reflect their 
personal  view(s)  and  that  no  part  of  their  compensation  was,  is  or  will  be  directly  or  indirectly  related  to  the  specific 
recommendation(s) or views contained in this research report: Evan Li, Summer Huang and Simon Fang. 
Important disclosures 
Equities: Stock ratings and basis for financial analysis 
HSBC believes an investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances such as the investor's 
existing holdings, risk tolerance and other considerations and that investors utilise various disciplines and investment horizons 
when  making  investment  decisions.  Ratings  should  not  be  used  or  relied  on  in  isolation  as  investment  advice.  Different 
securities  firms  use  a  variety  of  ratings  terms  as  well  as  different  rating  systems  to  describe  their  recommendations  and 
therefore investors should carefully read the definitions of the ratings used in each research report. Further, investors should 
carefully  read  the  entire  research  report  and  not  infer  its  contents  from  the  rating  because  research  reports  contain  more 
complete information concerning the analysts' views and the basis for the rating. 

From 23rd March 2015 HSBC has assigned ratings on the following basis: 
The target price is based on the analyst’s assessment of the stock’s actual current value, although we expect it to take six to 12 
months for the market price to reflect this.  When the target price is more than 20% above the current share price, the stock will 
be classified as a Buy; when it is between 5% and 20% above the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Buy or a 
Hold; when it is between 5% below and 5% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Hold; when it is 
between 5% and 20% below the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Hold or a Reduce; and when it is more 
than 20% below the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Reduce. 

Our ratings are re-calibrated against these bands at the time of any 'material change'  (initiation or resumption of coverage, 
change in target price or estimates).  

Upside/Downside is the percentage difference between the target price and the share price. 

Prior to this date, HSBC’s rating structure was applied on the following basis: 
For each stock we set a required rate of return calculated from the cost of equity for that stock’s domestic or, as appropriate, 
regional market established by our strategy team. The target price for a stock represented the value the analyst expected the 
stock  to  reach  over  our  performance  horizon.  The  performance  horizon  was  12  months.  For  a  stock  to  be  classified  as 
Overweight, the potential return, which equals the percentage difference between the current share price and the target price, 
including the forecast dividend yield when indicated, had to exceed the required return by at least 5 percentage points over the 
succeeding 12 months (or 10 percentage points for a stock classified as Volatile*). For a stock to be classified as Underweight, 
the stock was expected to underperform its required return by at least 5 percentage points over the succeeding 12 months (or 10 
percentage points for a stock classified as Volatile*).  Stocks between these bands were classified as Neutral. 

*A stock was classified as volatile if its historical volatility had exceeded 40%, if the stock had been listed for less than 12 
months (unless it was in an industry or sector where volatility is low) or if the analyst expected significant volatility.  However, 
stocks which we did not consider volatile may in fact also have behaved in such a way.  Historical volatility was defined as the 
past month's average of the daily 365-day moving average volatilities.  In order to avoid misleadingly frequent changes in 
rating, however, volatility had to move 2.5 percentage points past the 40% benchmark in either direction for a stock's status to 
change.

current model Buy = Buy, Hold = Hold and Reduce = Sell.  For rating definitions under both models, please see “Stock ratings
