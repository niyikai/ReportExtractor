Nord Anglia Education, Inc.
Solid Q1; is M&A catalyst looming?
Our  view:  On  Tuesday,  NORD  reported  a  solid  Q1,  maintained  FY17
guidance (net income/EPS were nudged higher), and indicated continued
optimism  around  its  growth  strategies.  M&A  in  the  near  term  sounds
likely,  and  is  needed  as  a  catalyst  for  the  shares.  We  continue  to  see
significant growth potential over the next few years. Outperform.

Key points:
Solid  Q1/F17  results.  Revenues  rose  8.7%  Y/Y  constant  currency  (6.9%
reported)  and  slightly  missed  consensus.  By  segment,  SEA  and  the  ME
were  a  bit  stronger,  while  North  America  and  China  were  a  bit  below.
Adjusted EBITDA margins fell ~200bps Y/Y due to heavy investments in
start-up schools and incremental costs related to the FY16 sale-leaseback
(rent, property taxes, etc.) and met our estimate. Adjusted EPS of $0.25
was flat Y/Y, and compared to our/consensus $0.24/$0.27 estimates.

M&A  on  the  horizon?  Management  stated  it  is  actively  engaged  in  a
number of advanced negotiations and hopes to be in position to announce
several  transaction  in  the  coming  months.  NORD  continues  to  target  ~
$200MM  for  M&A  in  FY17,  including  the  ~$167MM  in  sale  leaseback
proceeds  that  per  the  terms  of  its  credit  facility  must  be  committed
(though not technically spent) by May.

China  dual  curriculum  (DC)  and  greenfield  updates.  NORD  remains
confident in its China DC strategy, and highlighted the growth/demand in
its start-up in Shanghai (NACIS). It continues to plan for a second start-up
this fall, and is optimistic that it will receive needed regulatory approval
to do so. This would be incremental to NORD's planned September 2017
greenfield start-ups in Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Abu Dhabi.

FY17  guidance  benefits  from  debt  refinancing.  NORD  reiterated  its
FY17 guidance for revenue (~6.5-8.5% Y/Y growth) and adjusted EBITDA
(0-5%)  while  raising  adjusted  net  income/EPS  by  ~3%  to  incorporate  a
December debt refinancing (interest rates fall ~50 bps). As a result, the
adjusted  EPS  guide  rises  by  $0.02  to  $0.66-$0.71  (+2-10%  Y/Y).  Recall
the  modest  profit  growth  results  from  heavy  investments  in  start-up
schools and incremental Y/Y costs related to the sale-leaseback without
any assumption for use of proceeds (i.e., future M&A).

Estimates/PT. Our estimates are little changed, and our PT remains $27,
or an unchanged 22.5x CY18E FCF/share of $1.22 (vs. prior $1.21).

Bisbee's Bottom Line: Our positive thesis on NORD remains in place after
uneventful  Q1  results.  The  M&A  commentary  is  encouraging,  and  we
believe  that  future  announcements  are  likely  to  be  the  next  catalysts
for the stock. Looking further out, we believe NORD's large addressable
market, solid competitive advantages, profitable and predictable business
model, and strong cash flow (and ample dry powder today) position it to
drive strong growth and share price appreciation over time. Outperform.

Source: Bloomberg and RBC Capital Markets estimates for Upside/Downside/Target
Target price/base case
Our  base  case  calls  for  Nord  Anglia  to  deliver  high-single-
digit or better organic revenue growth, driven by same-school
growth and new start-up schools, with acquisitions likely to
drive upside over time. We assume modest adjusted EBITDA
margin expansion over time to drive 20%+ annual adjusted EPS
growth.

Our  $27  price  target  applies  a  22.5x  multiple  to  our  CY18
free  cash  flow  per  share  estimate  of  $1.22.  We  believe
this  premium  valuation  is  justified  by  the  company's  strong
business model and growth potential.

Upside scenario
Nord  Anglia  continues  to  reinvest  all  of  its  free  cash  flow
in  M&A  and  the  China  dual  curriculum  expansion  proves
successful,  which  leads  revenue  and  profits  to  grow  ~3%
ahead of our estimates in the next few years.

In this scenario, Nord Anglia could earn CY18 free cash flow
per share of ~$1.40 (vs. $1.22E). Assuming a 23x multiple, our
upside case is $32.

Downside scenario
Profit growth decelerates more than expected due to slower
M&A and rising organic capacity expansion (which weighs on
margins).

In this scenario, Nord Anglia could earn CY18 free cash flow
per share of ~$1.00 (vs. $1.22E). Assuming a 16x multiple, our
downside scenario is $16.

Investment summary
In  our  view,  Nord  Anglia  has  a  strong  growth  outlook  with
many positive aspects to its business model that make it an
attractive investment. Positives to the story include:

Strong growth outlook with diversified strategy. We believe
that  over  the  next  three  to  five  years,  Nord  Anglia  is  likely
to  generate  ~15%  revenue  growth  (8–10%  organic  and  5–
7% from M&A), 15–20% adjusted EBITDA growth, and 20%+
earnings  and  cash  flow  growth.  The  company  uses  a  three-
pronged  growth  strategy  that  has  enabled  it  to  increase  its
total  seat  capacity  four-fold  since  FY08.  Its  three  methods
of greenfield additions, capacity expansions, and acquisitions
have  enabled  it  to  take  advantage  of  different  growth
prospects and varying risk levels. We believe Nord Anglia has
strong potential to continue its rapid pace of growth.

Leading market position in fragmented market. The English-
language premium school market is large (~$58B) and highly
fragmented, with ~9,000 operators. 88% of the market is run
by single-school operators. With FY16 revenue of ~$850MM
and  43  schools,  Nord  Anglia  is  nearly  three  times  as  large
as the next biggest operator, but still has a vast addressable
market to pursue.

Premium  education,  competitive  advantages.  Nord  Anglia
solely  operates  premium  schools,  giving  it  a  well-respected
reputation. This reputation has enabled it to become a partner
of  choice  with  three  important  constituents:  operators  of
schools  looking  to  sell,  property  developers  looking  for
partners,  and  governments  looking  to  attract  foreign  direct
investment. We believe this creates competitive advantages
for Nord Anglia and acts as a barrier to entry for other, less
reputable schools.

Attractive  financial  model.  Nord  Anglia  has  a  strong
financial business model featuring high revenue and earnings
driven  by  long-term  leases,  ~97%  persistence  rate,  and
a  4.4-year  average  student  tenure.  NORD  has  healthier
margins (adjusted EBITDA >20%) and relatively price inelastic
consumers. Lastly, the company has a capital-efficient model
that combines with tuition pre-payments to generate strong
cash flows and healthy financial returns.

Risks  include:  1)  risks  associated  with  the  company's  M&A
and greenfield strategies; 2) China risks with this geography
generating  ~35%  of  profit  with  margins  well  above  the
corporate average; and 3) limited liquidity amid high sponsor
ownership.

FY17 guidance updated for refinancing, otherwise unchanged  
Nord  Anglia  left  its  FY17  guidance  largely  unchanged,  maintaining  the  revenue  ($910-$930 
million,  or  +6.5-8.5%  Y/Y  growth)  and  adjusted  EBITDA  ($207-$217  million,  or  0-5%  Y/Y 
growth)  outlooks.  The  company  raised  its  adjusted  net  income/EPS  outlook  by  ~3%  to 
incorporate the benefit from  a December refinancing (term loan and revolver interest rates 
lowered by 25-50 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively). As such, the guidance now 
calls  for  adjusted  EPS  of  $0.66-$0.71  (+$0.02  vs.  prior  $0.64-$0.69)  and  implies  2-10%  Y/Y 
growth (vs. prior 0-8%).   

Recall  that  the  modest  profit  growth  results  from  heavy  investments  in  recent  start-up 
schools (Chicago in Sep. 2015 and Houston and Shanghai in Sep. 2016) and incremental Y/Y 
costs related to the May 2016 sale-leaseback (rent, property taxes) without any assumption 
of use of proceeds. However, we believe the guidance could prove conservative as NORD has 
earmarked ~$200+ million for M&A during FY17. While the timing of M&A remains difficult 
to peg, the FY17 guidance is  somewhat punitive as it  assumes all costs related to the sale-
leaseback, but no use of proceeds. When this capital is put to work (M&A, growth capex, or 
debt reduction), we would expect accretion to the forward twelve months estimates. 

M&A on the horizon?  
Following 18+ months of M&A inactivity (and amid investor frustration), management stated 
it  was  actively  engaged  in  a  number  of  advanced  negotiations  and  that  it  hopes  to  be  in 
position  to  announce  several  transactions  in  the  coming  months.  Though  NORD  has  often 
cited  the  strength  and  quality  of  its  M&A  pipeline,  this  was  the  company’s  most  explicit 
update on likely near-term activity.   

As  part  of  NORD’s  FY17  capital  allocation  plans,  the  company  continues  to  earmark  ~$200 
million  of  capital  for  M&A.  This  includes  putting  the  ~$167  million  of  FY16  sale-leaseback 
proceeds to work. If these  funds are not  committed by May, the  terms of its credit  facility 
indicates that they would need to be used to pay down debt. While we expect the company 
to utilize much (if not all) of the sale leaseback proceeds for M&A, management also stated it 
is permitted to designate the proceeds for capital expenditures, thus providing added timing 
and capital flexibility. 

NORD  continues  to  have  dialog  with  a  range  of  potential  sellers  varying  in  size  (i.e.,  single 
operators, tuck-ins, groups) and despite the relative urgency, expects to remain disciplined 
on price (historically 7-10x EBITDA).  

We model 2-3 acquisitions at the end of  FY17 (to benefit  FY18  financials) and in each year 
thereafter  (~1,500  students/year),  though  we  believe  that  the  company  is  likely  to  exceed 
this target over time if it can execute against its pipeline and reinvest its free cash flow and 
incremental borrowings.

Nord Anglia Education, Inc.

China dual curriculum (China DC) and greenfields on track 
NORD remains confident in its China DC strategy, and continues to highlight the demand in 
its September 2016 start-up in Shanghai (NACIS), which it sold out immediately. The school is 
expected  to  be  EBTIDA  break-even  and  cash  flow  positive  in  its  first  year  and  reach  ~80% 
utilization maturity (~1,800 students) with margins that approximate the China expat market 
(~40%) in its third year.   

Management  also stated that it is making solid progress toward opening a  second Chinese 
local  school  for  September  2017.  Though  it  still  needs  to  secure  the  proper  licensing/ 
regulatory approval from the local authorities,  the company is optimistic that it will receive 
the  needed  approvals  to  open  a  second  school  this  September  as  long  as  it  secures  the 
licensing approval by early summer (vs. prior ~February timeline). This implies that most (if 
not all) other planning/strategy targets/requirements (i.e., land/building, financing, partners, 
etc.) have been met, in our view.   

Furthermore,  management  stated  that  its  three  start-ups  remain  on  track  to  open  in 
September 2017, including its school in Bangkok (1,500-seat capacity), Hong Kong (520), and 
Abu Dhabi (400).   

Thesis, estimates and price target largely unchanged  
Our positive investment thesis on Nord Anglia Education is unchanged after the solid, though 
uneventful,  Q1  results.  We  have  tweaked  our  model  to  incorporate  the  results,  updated 
guidance and commentary, though estimates only change slightly.    

We maintain our $27 price target, which applies a 22.5x multiple to our new CY18 free cash 
flow  per  share  estimate  of  $1.22  (vs.  prior  $1.21).  We  believe  the  premium  valuation  is 
justified  by  the  company’s  strong  business  model  and  growth  potential.  Our  price  target 
supports our Outperform rating.

 

China.  Sales  in  China  rose  +3.5%  Y/Y  constant  currency  (-2.0%  reported),  as  modest 
enrollment  and  tuition  increases  were  largely  offset  by  a  stronger  USD  and  an 
unfavorable  mix  of  enrollment  growth  from  lower-priced  schools  in  the  regions  (i.e., 
Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Chengdu). Adjusted EBITDA margins were largely unchanged 
(+12 basis points Y/Y to 42.3%).   

Europe.  On  a  constant  currency  basis,  European  revenues  grew  +2.3%  (vs.  +1.9% 
reported),  driven  by  enrollment  and  tuition  increases.  Margins  improved  modestly  Y/Y 
as  enrollment  growth,  tuition  increases,  and  lower  start-up  losses  at  its  Aubonne 
(September  2014  start-up,  Switzerland)  school  were  partially  offset  by  recent  costs  of 
capacity adds and a less favorable mix of enrollment growth from lower-priced schools.   

  Middle East. Middle East sales rose 9.3% constant currency (+9.1% reported) driven by 
strong organic enrollment growth in the region. Adjusted EBITDA margins rose 254 basis 
points  Y/Y  to  24.4%  driven  by  the  strong  growth,  favorable  mix  of  enrollment  growth 
from higher-priced schools, and improved utilization. 

 

Southeast  Asia.  Sales  in  Southeast  Asia  grew  15.5%  Y/Y  constant  currency  (17% 
reported), driven by enrollment growth (namely among its Vietnam Schools) and tuition 
increases.  Margins  rose  sharply  Y/Y,  driven  by  the  enrollment  and  utilization 
improvement in Vietnam.   

  North  America.  North  American  sales  rose  9.4%  Y/Y,  driven  by  enrollment  and  tuition 
growth.  Margins  fell  sharply  Y/Y  due  to  the  incremental  costs  resulting  from  the  FY16 
sale-leaseback (additional rent and taxes) and the recent Houston expansion (September 
2016).

China dual curriculum (China DC). Nord reported $3.3 million of revenues (446 average 
FTEs) from its recently opened school in Shanghai, which met our expectations and was 
in line with management’s bullish commentary. The school was slightly profitable, and is 
expected to be adjusted EBITDA break-even and cash flow positive for FY17.

Nord Anglia Education, Inc.

Valuation

Our $27 price target equates to 22.5x our CY18 free cash flow per share estimate of $1.22.
We believe this premium valuation is justified by the company's strong business model and
growth potential. Our price target supports our Outperform rating.

Risks to rating and price target

Company description

Key risks to our price target and rating include: 1) China risks with this geography generating
~35%  of  profit  with  margins  well  above  the  corporate  average  amid  greater  economic/
investor uncertainty in the region; 2) risks associated with the company's M&A and greenfield
strategies; and 3) high sponsor ownership.

Founded in 1972, Nord Anglia Education, Inc. is a leading international operator of premium
K-12  schools.  The  company  operates  43  schools  in  15  countries,  which  it  divides  into  six
operating segments: China, Europe, Middle East, Southeast Asia, North America, and China
Dual Curriculum (China DC). Almost all of its schools teach the English National Curriculum,
while few others teach the International Baccalaureate Curriculum, American Curriculum, and
Chinese Curriculum.

Nord Anglia has over 37,000 students with capacity for 49,000+. In FY16, average revenue
per student was approximately $24,400. The company derives all of its revenue from private
sources and focuses on geographic markets with high levels of foreign direct investment, large
expatriate populations, and rising disposable incomes.

RBC Capital Markets, LLC makes a market in the securities of Nord Anglia Education, Inc..
Explanation of RBC Capital Markets Equity rating system
An analyst's 'sector' is the universe of companies for which the analyst provides research coverage. Accordingly, the rating assigned
to  a  particular  stock  represents  solely  the  analyst's  view  of  how  that  stock  will  perform  over  the  next  12  months  relative  to
the analyst's sector average. Although RBC Capital Markets' ratings of Top Pick (TP)/Outperform (O), Sector Perform (SP), and
Underperform (U) most closely correspond to Buy, Hold/Neutral and Sell, respectively, the meanings are not the same because
our ratings are determined on a relative basis.
Ratings
Top Pick (TP): Represents analyst's best idea in the sector; expected to provide significant absolute total return over 12 months
with a favorable risk-reward ratio.
Outperform (O): Expected to materially outperform sector average over 12 months.
Sector Perform (SP): Returns expected to be in line with sector average over 12 months.
Underperform (U): Returns expected to be materially below sector average over 12 months.
Risk Rating
As of March 31, 2013, RBC Capital Markets suspends its Average and Above Average risk ratings. The Speculative risk rating reflects
a security's lower level of financial or operating predictability, illiquid share trading volumes, high balance sheet leverage, or limited
operating history that result in a higher expectation of financial and/or stock price volatility.
Distribution of ratings
For the purpose of ratings distributions, regulatory rules require member firms to assign ratings to one of three rating categories
- Buy, Hold/Neutral, or Sell - regardless of a firm's own rating categories. Although RBC Capital Markets' ratings of Top Pick(TP)/
Outperform (O), Sector Perform (SP), and Underperform (U) most closely correspond to Buy, Hold/Neutral and Sell, respectively,
the meanings are not the same because our ratings are determined on a relative basis (as described above).

RBC Capital Markets endeavors to make all reasonable efforts to provide research simultaneously to all eligible clients, having
regard to local time zones in overseas jurisdictions. RBC Capital Markets' equity research is posted to our proprietary website
to ensure eligible clients receive coverage initiations and changes in ratings, targets and opinions in a timely manner. Additional
distribution  may  be  done  by  the  sales  personnel  via  email,  fax,  or  other  electronic  means,  or  regular  mail.  Clients  may  also
receive our research via third party vendors. RBC Capital Markets also provides eligible clients with access to SPARC on the Firms
proprietary  INSIGHT  website,  via  email  and  via  third-party  vendors.  SPARC  contains  market  color  and  commentary  regarding
subject companies on which the Firm currently provides equity research coverage. Research Analysts may, from time to time,
include  short-term  trade  ideas  in  research  reports  and  /  or  in  SPARC.  A  short-term  trade  idea  offers  a  short-term  view  on
how a security may trade, based on market and trading events, and the resulting trading opportunity that may be available. A
short-term trade idea may differ from the price targets and recommendations in our published research reports reflecting the
research analyst's views of the longer-term (one year) prospects of the subject company, as a result of the differing time horizons,
methodologies and/or other factors. Thus, it is possible that a subject company's common equity that is considered a long-term
'Sector Perform' or even an 'Underperform' might present a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary selling pressure
in the market; conversely, a subject company's common equity rated a long-term 'Outperform' could be considered susceptible
to a short-term downward price correction. Short-term trade ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system, and
the firm generally does not intend, nor undertakes any obligation, to maintain or update short-term trade ideas. Short-term trade
ideas may not be suitable for all investors and have not been tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and
investors should make their own independent decisions regarding any securities or strategies discussed herein. Please contact
your investment advisor or institutional salesperson for more information regarding RBC Capital Markets' research.
