A visionary leader   
The  flagship  of  China’s  Securities  industry  with  balanced  business 
structure. CITIC Securities is the biggest securities firm in China in terms of 
revenue,  assets  and  equity  scales.  Brokerage,  investment  banking,  asset 
management, 
income  (non-recurring  gain  on  disposal  of 
subsidiaries income excluded) and interest income contribute 30%, 12%, 2%, 
21%  and  12%  to  total  FY11  revenue  respectively.  We  perceive  it  the  most 
balanced and optimized revenue structure among peers.

Acquisition  demonstrates  ambition  of 
internationalization.  The 
acquisition of CLSA signals CITIC's ambition to expand overseas and become 
a world-class investment bank which focuses in China with globalized vision. 
Although  the  market  questions  the  price  CITIC  paid  in  the  acquisition  we 
believe  the  valuation  is  fair  given  the  complementary  effects  between  CITIC 
and CLSA: CLSA can take advantage of    CITIC’s investment banking client 
access,  political  connections  in  Beijing  and  strong  capital  base,  while  CITIC 
can  tap  into  CLSA’s  international  distribution  network  to  develop  its  global 
presence.   

Synergy  forged  from  buy-side  and  sell-side  business.  CITIC  has 
constructed  a  new  business  model  –  the  sell-side  business  accumulates 
investor resources, capital, and brand recognition, and the buy-side business 
utilize  these  resource  provided  by  the  sell-side  to  realize  profits  so  as  to 
leverage  up  capital  utilization  and  increase ROE.  In future,  CITIC’s  buy-side 
business will skew towards flow-based business. 

Early-mover  advantages  from  innovation.  CITIC  has  been  the  pioneer  of 
many innovative businesses and has achieved considerable market share. In 
FY11,  CITIC’s  innovation  expanded  to  asset  management,  futures,  PE, 
industry  fund,  margin financing,  and  stocks  index  futures  trading  businesses 
together recorded revenue of RMB 4.7bn, accounting for 35% of total revenue, 
higher than industry average of 11%.   

Valuation. We evaluate the values of each CITIC business lines, sum them up 
to reach the value of the firm. We assign a FY12 P/E of 17x to the brokerage 
business,  18x  to  the  investment  banking  business,  1.2x  to  investment 
business,  P/AUM  of  7%  to  the  asset  management  business  and  1x  to  the 
cash-on-hand to  derive the  target  price  of  HK$  15.7,  implying  a  FY12  PB  of 
1.5x.
